Hi, I'm Moritz from Cologne, Germany.
{INSERT OBLIGATORY EMOJIS HERE}

I love 
* music (especially Bach and techno)
* the web
* coding
* running
* cats
* cloudy skies
* learning, getting to know people
* talking and listening

In my day job, I mostly code PHP, JS, HTML, CSS and (sadly) TYPO3 stuff.

Here I share my toy and learning projects.

The first one I'd call an actual "project" is
https://strlns.github.io/ksuduo/index.html

The goal here was to learn React and TypeScript. It grew and grew, code is partly sloppy and I went all the way down the rabbit-hole of solving and generating sudokos :)

https://strlns.github.io/thirty-six/
is a variation of the same thing, but with six 3x2 blocks. That makes the puzzles very easy.

This repo is my playground to learn about three.js and WebGL.
Also, there I am using ES2021 with script `type="module"` and without any transpiling for the first time.
Currently it's just the rotating cube example from three.js tutorial, see description. 
Goal in next spare time is some basic 3D animation fun.

My next goals are 

* getting better at all kinds of web technology
* grow my server-side skills and become a more versatile developer
* find more project ideas that fascinate me
