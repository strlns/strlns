Hi, I'm Moritz from Cologne, Germany.
{INSERT OBLIGATORY EMOJIS HERE}

I love 
* music (especially Bach and techno)
* the web
* coding
* running
* cats
* cloudy skies
* learning, getting to know people
* talking and listening

In my day job, I mostly code PHP, JS, HTML, CSS and (sadly) TYPO3 stuff.

Here I share my toy and learning projects.

The first one I'd call an actual "project" is
https://strlns.github.io/ksuduo/index.html

The goal here was to learn React and TypeScript. It grew and grew, code is partly sloppy and I went all the way down the rabbit-hole of solving and generating sudokos :)

which is a variation of the same thing, but with six 3x2 blocks. That makes the puzzles very easy.

My next goals are 

* getting better at all kinds of web technology
* grow my server-side skills and become a more versatile developer
* find more project ideas that fascinate me

If you like, you can get in touch with me on GitHub.
Currently I don't have a dedicated "developer's e-mail address".
